# PokéPC Followers Mod — Gen 1 + Gen 2

An all-species overworld follower mod for **Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, and Gold (Gen1Recomp)**. Every Generation I Pokémon is supported out of the box; Gold supplies all 251 species natively, while Gen 1 can add Johto species through a compatible expansion such as **Crystal 251**.

---

## 🌟 Features

* **All 251 Gen 1 + Gen 2 Pokémon Supported**: Every Pokémon from Bulbasaur `#001` to Celebi `#251` has full overworld sprite animations.
* **Crystal 251 Compatibility**: Johto species are detected from Crystal 251's registered Pokédex data instead of relying on a second hard-coded species table.
* **Automatic Party Slot 1 Follower**: By default, your overworld follower automatically mirrors whichever Pokémon is in **Party Slot 1**. Swapping your party order or receiving a new lead Pokémon dynamically updates your overworld companion.
* **Party Menu UI Selection**:
  1. Press `START` -> select `POKéMON`.
  2. Choose any Pokémon in your party.
  3. Select the new **`FOLLOW?`** option (the current follower reads **`FOLLOWER`**).
  4. Your chosen Pokémon will instantly become your active follower!
* **Full-Color Overworld Graphics**: Sprites render with rich true-color graphics directly over 100% colorized overworld terrain tiles (grass, paths, dirt, water) with zero background artifacts.
* **Pokédex-Proportional Sizes**: Followers use the height recorded in their Pokédex entry. A progressive and capped scale keeps the smallest Pokémon at least 11 px tall while making very large Pokémon clearly more imposing, without changing collision or movement.
* **Smooth Movement Mechanics**:
  * Smooth 1-tile trailing behind the player.
  * In-place turning (no teleporting or jumping tiles when turning around).
  * Seamless map transition spawning across route seams and indoor/outdoor warps.

## 📋 Installation

**PokePCFollowers 0.8.2 requires Gen1Recomp 0.1.86 or newer.** Install the ZIP from the GitHub release through `MODS > Import mod .zip`, or place the unpacked mod inside `mods/`.

The sandbox entry point is `main_sandbox.lua`; it loads the existing follower implementation through Gen1Recomp's scoped mod APIs.

On Red, Blue, or Yellow, install and import **Crystal 251** to use Pokémon `#152`–`#251`. On Gold, all 251 species work directly from the game's own Pokédex data.

The manifest targets both `gen1` and `gen2`; no second Gold-specific copy of the mod is needed.

### Follower size options

`POKEDEX SIZES` enables or disables proportional follower sizes. `FOLLOWER SIZE`
adjusts the result globally from 75% to 125%. The default 100% setting uses the
Pokédex-derived scale. Only the visual sprite changes: followers still occupy one
logical map cell and retain their normal movement and interactions.

## Gen1Recomp 0.1.86+ sandbox compatibility

Version 0.8.2 is migrated to the Gen1Recomp per-mod sandbox. The mod does not request raw filesystem access. Its own asset paths are rooted through `mod.assets:path(...)`, its legacy implementation is read through `mod:read(...)`, and cross-mod integration continues through `mod.find(...).exports`.

The old Gen 1 fallback that depended on `debug.getupvalue` is no longer required at runtime: the sandbox entry installs a narrow follower-spawn compatibility seam before the existing implementation loads. This keeps Red/Blue follower spawning functional even though the sandbox intentionally does not expose the Lua `debug` library.

## 👥 Credits & Acknowledgments

* **Generation I + II Overworld Sprites**: Huge credit and special thanks to ShockSlayer, the makers of the legendary ROM hack **Pokémon Crystal Clear**, and the PokéPC / Followers EX lineage for the native GSC-style follower sheets. The Generation II sheets are distributed in the built-in Poke Followers pack from [Wilds of Kanto](https://github.com/YoDrehDenSwagAuf/overworld-spawn-mod). See [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
* **Crystal 251 Integration**: Species identities and National Pokédex numbers are read from [Crystal 251](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-crystal-251) at runtime. No Crystal ROM content is bundled by this mod.
* **Development**: Built with **vibe coding** and pair programming for the `pokemon-gen1-recomp` project.

## Voxel compatibility

This build includes compatibility for Dramatic Shape-family voxel providers. The follower sprite is resolved dynamically through `SpriteRenderer:resolveImage()` as well as the normal 2D draw hook, preventing voxel mode from sampling the registered Charmander fallback sheet for every follower.

The follower sprite is also marked `trueColor` for render-pipeline use so the voxel renderer does not run the fixed `SPRITE_PIKACHU` image through its palette bake. Pokédex-derived sizes are forwarded to the billboard and shadow meshes used by Dramatic Shape, Dramaless Shape and Battle Art Voxel Fork.

## Inter-mod compatibility

Version 0.8.2 keeps its renderer, party-menu, follower and Yellow encounter wrappers chain-safe. During a hot reload it restores a function only when its own wrapper is still the active outermost function, so wrappers installed by later-loading mods are not overwritten. This is intended for stacks containing Dramatic Sky Ride, Kanto Dive or the standalone Dramatic Deep Dive; those mods remain responsible for their own mount and underwater movement rules.

When [Unique Menu Icons](https://github.com/menyas/unique-menu-icons) is also enabled, it owns the party-menu icon column and its color mode. PokePC keeps providing the overworld follower and the `FOLLOW?` action, but stops marking the party rows as true color. Without Unique Menu Icons, PokePC's own party icons remain the fallback. Use Unique Menu Icons 1.5.0 or newer; version 1.4.0 declares PokePC incompatible in its manifest.

## Red/Blue follower support

The mod extends the follower entity to Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue. The stock Gen 1 `PikachuFollower` spawn condition is Yellow/Pikachu-specific, so PokePC supplies a version-neutral healthy-party condition while retaining the engine's native trailing, ledge and map-transition behavior.

Yellow-only Oak story/encounter overrides remain restricted to Yellow and are not applied to Red, Blue, or Gold.

## Gold support

PokePC targets the Gen 2 engine directly. It uses Gold's follower spawn seam, native 251-species Pokédex, Gen 2 sprite registry, and split icon sheet/species registry. Followers are hidden correctly while biking or surfing, and the Party Menu `FOLLOW?` action uses the same shared hook as Gen 1.

## Fainted lead fix (0.8.4)

Under the 0.1.86+ sandbox the follower vanished entirely whenever party slot 1
was at 0 HP, even with a different healthy Pokémon selected as the follower.
The native Gen 1 spawn gate scans the party for a mon that is both named
`PIKACHU` and above 0 HP; the compatibility shim spoofed slot 1's species but
not its HP, so a fainted lead failed the gate and no other slot matched. The
shim now borrows the selected follower's own slot instead, so both halves of
the native test are satisfied by the same mon without mutating any HP value.

## Animation fix

The follower sprite definition is explicitly marked as a walking sprite (`walker=true`). Gen1Recomp uses this flag to provide the `walkPhase` state used by the 6-frame overworld sheets, so the follower switches between standing and walking frames correctly.
